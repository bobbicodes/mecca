Within `:after` it grafts the handler's return value\n  back into db, at the right path.\n\n  So, its overall action is to make the event handler behave like the function\n  you might give to clojure's `update-in`.\n\n  Examples:\n\n      (path :some :path)\n      (path [:some :path])\n      (path [:some :path] :to :here)\n      (path [:some :path] [:to] :here)\n\n  Example Use:\n\n      (reg-event-db\n        :event-id\n        (path [:a :b])  ;; used here, in interceptor chain\n        (fn [b v]       ;; 1st arg is now not db. Is the value from path [:a :b] within db\n          ... new-b))   ;; returns a new value for that path (not the entire db)\n\n  Notes:\n    1. `path` may appear more than once in an interceptor chain. Progressive narrowing.\n    2. if `:effects` contains no `:db` effect, can't graft a value back in.\n  \"\n  [& args]\n  (let [path (flatten args)\n        db-store-key :re-frame-path/db-store]    ;; this is where, within `context`, we store the original dbs\n    (when (empty? path)\n      (console :error \"re-frame: \\\"path\\\" interceptor given no params\"))\n    (->interceptor\n      :id      :path\n      :before  (fn\n                 [context]\n                 (let [original-db (get-coeffect context :db)]\n                   (-> context\n                       (update db-store-key conj original-db)\n                       (assoc-coeffect :db (get-in original-db path)))))\n      :after   (fn [context]\n                 (let [db-store     (db-store-key context)\n                       original-db  (peek db-store)\n                       new-db-store (pop db-store)\n                       context'     (-> (assoc context db-store-key new-db-store)\n                                        (assoc-coeffect :db original-db))     ;; put the original db back so that things like debug work later on\n                       db           (get-effect context :db ::not-found)]\n                   (if (= db ::not-found)\n                     context'\n                     (->> (assoc-in original-db path db)\n                          (assoc-effect context' :db))))))))\n\n\n\n\n(defn enrich\n  \"Interceptor factory which runs the given function `f` in the `after handler`\n  position.  `f` is called with two arguments: `db` and `v`, and is expected to\n  return a modified `db`.\n\n  Unlike the `after` interceptor which is only about side effects, `enrich`\n  expects `f` to process and alter the given `db` coeffect in some useful way,\n  contributing to the derived data, flowing vibe.\n\n  Example Use:\n  ------------\n\n  Imagine that todomvc needed to do duplicate detection - if any two todos had\n  the same text, then highlight their background, and report them via a warning\n  at the bottom of the panel.\n\n  Almost any user action (edit text, add new todo, remove a todo) requires a\n  complete reassessment of duplication errors and warnings. Eg: that edit\n  just made might have introduced a new duplicate, or removed one. Same with\n  any todo removal. So we need to re-calculate warnings after any CRUD events\n  associated with the todos list.\n\n  Unless we are careful, we might end up coding subtly different checks\n  for each kind of CRUD operation.  The duplicates check made after\n  'delete todo' event might be subtly different to that done after an\n  editing operation. Nice and efficient, but fiddly. A bug generator\n  approach.\n\n  So, instead, we create an `f` which recalculates ALL warnings from scratch\n  every time there is ANY change. It will inspect all the todos, and\n  reset ALL FLAGS every time (overwriting what was there previously)\n  and fully recalculate the list of duplicates (displayed at the bottom?).\n\n  https://twitter.com/nathanmarz/status/879722740776939520\n\n  By applying `f` in an `:enrich` interceptor, after every CRUD event,\n  we keep the handlers simple and yet we ensure this important step\n  (of getting warnings right) is not missed on any change.\n\n  We can test `f` easily - it is a pure function - independently of\n  any CRUD operation.\n\n  This brings huge simplicity at the expense of some re-computation\n  each time.
