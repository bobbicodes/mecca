Later, add an interceptor to an -fx event handler, using `inject-cofx`:\n\n      (re-frame.core/reg-event-fx        ;; we are registering an event handler\n         :event-id\n         [ ... (inject-cofx :datetime) ... ]    ;; <-- create an injecting interceptor\n         (fn event-handler\n           [coeffect event]\n           ... in here can access (:now coeffect) to obtain current datetime ... )))\n\n   Background\n   ----------\n\n   `coeffects` are the input resources required by an event handler\n   to perform its job. The two most obvious ones are `db` and `event`.\n   But sometimes an event handler might need other resources.\n\n   Perhaps an event handler needs a random number or a GUID or the current\n   datetime. Perhaps it needs access to a DataScript database connection.\n\n   If an event handler directly accesses these resources, it stops being\n   pure and, consequently, it becomes harder to test, etc. So we don't\n   want that.\n\n   Instead, the interceptor created by this function is a way to 'inject'\n   'necessary resources' into the `:coeffects` (map) subsequently given\n   to the event handler at call time.\"\n  ([id]\n  (->interceptor\n    :id      :coeffects\n    :before  (fn coeffects-before\n               [context]\n               (if-let [handler (get-handler kind id)]\n                 (update context :coeffects handler)\n                 (console :error \"No cofx handler registered for\" id)))))\n  ([id value]\n   (->interceptor\n     :id     :coeffects\n     :before  (fn coeffects-before\n                [context]\n                (if-let [handler (get-handler kind id)]\n                  (update context :coeffects handler value)\n                  (console :error \"No cofx handler registered for\" id))))))\n\n\n;; -- Builtin CoEffects Handlers  ---------------------------------------------\n\n;; :db\n;;\n;; Adds to coeffects the value in `app-db`, under the key `:db`\n(reg-cofx\n  :db\n  (fn db-coeffects-handler\n    [coeffects]\n    (assoc coeffects :db @app-db)))\n\n\n;; Because this interceptor is used so much, we reify it\n(def inject-db (inject-cofx :db))\n\n\n"]}
