A signal function is explicitly supplied:\n     ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       signal-fn     ;; <-- here\n       computation-fn)\n     ```\n     \n     This is the most canonical and instructive of the three variations.\n     \n     When a node is created from the template, the `signal-fn` will be called and it\n     is expected to return the input signal(s) as either a singleton, if there is only\n     one, or a sequence if there are many, or a map with the signals as the values.\n\n     The values from returned nominated signals will be supplied as the 1st argument to  \n     the `a-computation-fn` when it is called - and subject to what this `signal-fn` returns, \n     this value will be either a singleton, sequence or map of them (paralleling\n     the structure returned by the `signal-fn`).\n\n     This example `signal-fn` returns a vector of input signals.\n       ```clj\n       (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n         [(subscribe [:a-sub])\n          (subscribe [:b-sub])])\n       ```\n     The associated computation function must be written\n     to expect a vector of values for its first argument:\n       ```clj\n       (fn [[a b] query-vec]     ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n         ....)\n        ```\n\n     If, on the other hand, the signal function was simpler and returned a singleton, like this:\n        ```clj\n        (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n          (subscribe [:a-sub]))\n        ```\n     then the associated computation function must be written to expect a single value\n     as the 1st argument:\n        ```clj\n        (fn [a query-vec]       ;; 1st argument is a single value\n          ...)\n        ```\n \n     Further Note: variation #1 above, in which an `input-fn` was not supplied, like this:\n       ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n     ```\n     is the equivalent of using this\n     2nd variation and explicitly suppling a `signal-fn` which returns `app-db`:\n     ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       (fn [_ _]  re-frame/app-db)   ;; <--- explicit input-fn \n       a-computation-fn)             ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n     ```\n \n  3. Syntax Sugar\n\n     ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :a-b-sub\n       :<- [:a-sub]\n       :<- [:b-sub]\n       (fn [[a b] query-vec]    ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n         {:a a :b b}))\n     ```\n\n     This 3rd variation is just syntactic sugar for the 2nd.  Instead of providing an\n     `signals-fn` you provide one or more pairs of `:<-` and a subscription vector.\n\n     If you supply only one pair a singleton will be supplied to the computation function, \n     as if you had supplied a `signal-fn` returning only a single value:\n\n     ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :a-sub\n       :<- [:a-sub]\n       (fn [a query-vec]      ;; only one pair, so 1st argument is a single value\n         ...))\n     ```\n\n  For further understanding, read `/docs`, and look at the detailed comments in\n  /examples/todomvc/src/subs.cljs\n  "],"~$query->reaction",["^ ","^A","~$day8.re-frame-10x.inlined-deps.re-frame.v0v10v9.re-frame.subs/query->reaction","^U","resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/subs.cljc","^V",18,"^W",1,"^X",18,"^Y",21,"^T",["^ ","^U","/home/porky/mecca/resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/subs.cljc","^V",18,"^W",6,"^X",18,"^Y",21],"~:tag","~$any"],"~$clear-all-handlers!",["^ ","^S",null,"^T",["^ ","^U","/home/porky/mecca/resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/subs.cljc","^V",36,"^W",7,"^X",36,"^Y",26,"^Z",["^[",["^10",["^[",[[]]]]],"^11","Unregisters all existing subscription handlers"],"^A","~$day8.re-frame-10x.inlined-deps.re-frame.v0v10v9.re-frame.subs/clear-all-handlers!","^13",false,"^U","resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/subs.cljc","^Y",26,"^14",["^[",[[]]],"^15",null,"^16",["^[",[null,null]],"^W",1,"^V",36,"^X",36,"^17",0,"^18",true,"^Z",["^[",["^10",["^[",[[]]]]],"^11","Unregisters all existing subscription handlers"],"~$cache-lookup",["^ ","^S",null,"^T",["^ ","^U","/home/porky/mecca/resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/subs.cljc","^V",65,"^W",7,"^X",65,"^Y",19,"^Z",["^[",["^10",["^[",[["^1:"],["^1:","~$dyn-v"]]]]],"^1D",["^ ","^13",false,"^17",2,"^14",["^[",[["^1:"],["^1:","^1P"]]],"^Z",["^[",[["^1:"],["^1:","^1P"]]],"^16",["^[",[null,null]]]],"^A","~$day8.re-frame-10x.inlined-deps.re-frame.v0v10v9.re-frame.subs/cache-lookup","^13",false,"^U","resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/subs.cljc","^Y",19,"^1D",["^ ","^13",false,"^17",2,"^14",["^[",[["^1:"],["^1:","^1P"]]],"^Z",["^[",[["^1:"],["^1:","^1P"]]],"^16",["^[",[null,null]]],"^14",["^[",[["^1:"],["^1:","^1P"]]],"^15",null,"^16",["^[",[null,null]],"^W",1,"^V",65,"^X",65,"^17",2,"^18",true,"^Z",["^[",[["^1:"],["^1:","^1P"]]]],"~$map-vals",["^ ","^S",null,"^T",["^ ","^U","/home/porky/mecca/resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/subs.cljc","^V",163,"^W",8,"^X",163,"^Y",16,"^1>",true,"^Z",["^[",["^10",["^[",[["~$f","~$m"]]]]],"^11","Returns a new version of 'm' in which 'f' has been applied to each value.\n  (map-vals inc {:a 4, :b 2}) => {:a 5, :b 3}"],"^1>",true,"^A","~$day8.re-frame-10x.inlined-deps.re-frame.v0v10v9.re-frame.subs/map-vals","^13",false,"^U","resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/subs.cljc","^Y",16,"^14",["^[",[["~$f","~$m"]]],"^15",null,"^16",["^[",[null,null]],"^W",1,"^V",163,"^X",163,"^17",2,"^18",true,"^Z",["^[",["^10",["^[",[["~$f","~$m"]]]]],"^11","Returns a new version of 'm' in which 'f' has been applied to each value.\n  (map-vals inc {:a 4, :b 2}) => {:a 5, :b 3}"],"~$kind",["^ ","^A","~$day8.re-frame-10x.inlined-deps.re-frame.v0v10v9.re-frame.subs/kind","^U","resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/subs.cljc","^V",10,"^W",1,"^X",10,"^Y",10,"^T",["^ ","^U","/home/porky/mecca/resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/subs.cljc","^V",10,"^W",6,"^X",10,"^Y",10],"^1K","~$cljs.core/Keyword"],"~$clear-subscription-cache!",["^ ","^S",null,"^T",["^ ","^U","/home/porky/mecca/resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/subs.cljc","^V",20,"^W",7,"^X",20,"^Y",32,"^Z",["^[",["^10",["^[",[[]]]]],"^11","Causes all subscriptions to be removed from the cache.\n  Does this by:\n     1. running `on-dispose` on all cached subscriptions\n     2.
