But interceptors can\n   add whatever they want to `:coeffects` - perhaps the event handler needs\n   some information from localstore, or a random number, or access to\n   a DataScript connection.\n\n   Equally, some interceptors in the chain will have `:after` fn\n   which can process the side effects accumulated into `:effects`\n   including but, not limited to, updates to app-db.\n\n   Through both stages (before and after), `context` contains a `:queue`\n   of interceptors yet to be processed, and a `:stack` of interceptors\n   already done.  In advanced cases, these values can be modified by the\n   functions through which the context is threaded."],"~$assoc-effect",["^ ","^H",null,"^I",["^ ","^J","/home/porky/mecca/resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/interceptor.cljc","^K",39,"^L",7,"^M",39,"^N",19,"^O",["^P",["^Q",["^P",[["^R","^S","^17"]]]]]],"^<","~$day8.re-frame-10x.inlined-deps.re-frame.v0v10v9.re-frame.interceptor/assoc-effect","^V",false,"^J","resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/interceptor.cljc","^N",19,"^X",["^P",[["^R","^S","^17"]]],"^[",null,"^Y",["^P",[null,null]],"^L",1,"^K",39,"^M",39,"^W",3,"^10",true,"^O",["^P",["^Q",["^P",[["^R","^S","^17"]]]]]],"~$enqueue",["^ ","^H",null,"^I",["^ ","^J","/home/porky/mecca/resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/interceptor.cljc","^K",112,"^L",7,"^M",112,"^N",14,"^O",["^P",["^Q",["^P",[["^R","^1L"]]]]],"^14","Add a collection of `interceptors` to the end of `context's` execution `:queue`.\n  Returns the updated `context`.\n\n  In an advanced case, this function could allow an interceptor to add new\n  interceptors to the `:queue` of a context."],"^<","~$day8.re-frame-10x.inlined-deps.re-frame.v0v10v9.re-frame.interceptor/enqueue","^V",false,"^J","resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/interceptor.cljc","^N",14,"^X",["^P",[["^R","^1L"]]],"^[",null,"^Y",["^P",[null,null]],"^L",1,"^K",112,"^M",112,"^W",2,"^10",true,"^O",["^P",["^Q",["^P",[["^R","^1L"]]]]],"^14","Add a collection of `interceptors` to the end of `context's` execution `:queue`.\n  Returns the updated `context`.\n\n  In an advanced case, this function could allow an interceptor to add new\n  interceptors to the `:queue` of a context."],"~$mandatory-interceptor-keys",["^ ","^<","~$day8.re-frame-10x.inlined-deps.re-frame.v0v10v9.re-frame.interceptor/mandatory-interceptor-keys","^J","resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/interceptor.cljc","^K",9,"^L",1,"^M",9,"^N",32,"^I",["^ ","^J","/home/porky/mecca/resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/interceptor.cljc","^K",9,"^L",6,"^M",9,"^N",32],"~:tag","~$cljs.core/ISet"],"~$interceptor?",["^ ","^H",null,"^I",["^ ","^J","/home/porky/mecca/resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/interceptor.cljc","^K",11,"^L",7,"^M",11,"^N",19,"^O",["^P",["^Q",["^P",[["~$m"]]]]]],"^<","~$day8.re-frame-10x.inlined-deps.re-frame.v0v10v9.re-frame.interceptor/interceptor?","^V",false,"^J","resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/interceptor.cljc","^N",19,"^X",["^P",[["~$m"]]],"^[",null,"^Y",["^P",[null,null]],"^L",1,"^K",11,"^M",11,"^W",1,"^10",true,"^O",["^P",["^Q",["^P",[["~$m"]]]]]],"~$change-direction",["^ ","^H",null,"^I",["^ ","^J","/home/porky/mecca/resources/public/cljs-out/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v0v10v9/re_frame/interceptor.cljc","^K",135,"^L",8,"^M",135,"^N",24,"^12",true,"^O",["^P",["^Q",["^P",[["^R"]]]]],"^14","Called on completion of `:before` processing, this function prepares/modifies\n   `context` for the backwards sweep of processing in which an interceptor\n   chain's `:after` fns are called.\n\n  At this point in processing, the `:queue` is empty and `:stack` holds all\n  the previously run interceptors.
